# CLASSICS 136: Archimedes Invents Physics

Parabola is to the triangle it conttains as a ratio 4:3, from Quadratrue of the Parabola.

Archimedes actually proved this in 3 different ways using lines and trapezoids etc.

Method had lots of measurements based on the parabola, lots of geometric objects.

Replicate Archimedes "crown experiment" measuring density.



### The Parabola and the Balance

Archimedes talks a lot about the balance because it's familiar. Greeks had the traditional balance with two equidistant weights, but also had a balance with one movable weight which says that they understood balanced pretty well.

Archimedes exploits the mechanics of the balance as a mathematical tool. Tries to gain a mathematical understanding of the physics behind the balance.

Floating bodies still exists in Greek. Paired with another work called Balancing Planes.



### Balancing Planes and Floating Bodies

Balancing Planes Book 1 is about basic hypotheses concering balances, center of weights of triangle and trapezium. Book 2 is about center of parabolic segments.

Floating Bodies book 1 is about the behavior of liquid, how solids immersed in liquid cause the liquid to move up. Introducing conditions for stability in a solid/liquid environment. Book 2 is on the law of Bouyancy and conditions for stability for segments of paraboloid of revolution immersed in liquid.

Axiomatic introduction to Balancing Planes. Equal weights are balanced at equal distance from each other.

What's confusing to mathematicians is that Archimedes doesn't explain what weights or balancing means.

The center of a plane is where if the plane was hung from a thread it will remain stable and parallel to the horizon. 

Equal weights do NOT balance at unequal distances. But the actual point of balance is towards the greater distance. The weight further from the fulcrum will be inclined down.

Given two weights that are balanced, if weight is added to one weight then that weight will destabilize the system and the system will incline towards that weight. Removing weight similar idea.

Given two shapes that are similar, the centers are similarly situated.
