# CLASSICS 136: Archimedes Part 2

Archimedes, unlike Euclid and Hippocrates, was very famous. Lots of stories were written about him. Mostly fictional stories / depictions.

*Archimedes lever, Archimedes optics.*

A potentially non-fictional story about Archimede's grave being a cylinder + a sphere.

Probably because he was proud of his first book:

### Archimedes Sphere and Cylinder I

> The surface of a sphere is 3 times largest circle in the sphere.
> 
> The sphere is exactly 2/3 of the enclosing cylinder.

![Spheres in Cylinders](https://datagenetics.com/blog/july32014/sphere2.png)

A result on polygons and circles: *the circumfrence of a circle inscibed in a polygon is smaller than the perimeter of the polygon*.

Figures that enclose cones, cones the enclose figures lots of interesting findings.

**Ancient Diagrams aren't pictorally precise** but rather a general representation.

Got to spheres by rotating a polygon within a circle around the diameter, conic slices.

Combines several original ideas which is probably why Archimedes was proud of it.

A sphere is like a cone with the radius of the sphere as the height and the surface of the sphere as the base of the cone (think about this for a bit and see if it makes sense).

Archimedes approximated $\pi$ using a polygon inscribed in a circle with 96 sides.

(Example in class) How to show surface of a sphere is 4x the largest circle.

A lot of results from the combination of combining sections of geometry. Think creatively about how to disect a partifcular geometry into elements (think polygon inscribed in a circle).

Proof by the usual Eudoxus method of double contradiction.

Volume of a sphere, surface of a sphere, largest circle: genius proof.

Archimedes was thinking about cones *all the time.*

### A Hellenistic Author

> Some King Gelon, think that the number of sand is infinite in its multitude, other think that there is so much that there is no named number that could exceed the multitude of sand.

Archimedes wanted to estimate the size of the "universe". In the Greek model where the universe is like a sphere.

Big numbers in Greek were hard. Largest number was 10,000 or a "myriad".

So $10^8$ = myriad-myriads and if we extend the language as far as we can get myriad-myriads of the myriad-myriadth numbers of the myriad-myriadth circuit which is 1 followed by 80 quadrillion zeroes.

Archimedes does some kind of calculation of  the number of grains of sand to fill the universe and gets a thousand myriads of the seventh numbers or around $10^{56}$ grains of sand, that's a lot!

**The Cattle Problem**

> Understand that the white bulls were equal to a half and a third of the black together with the whole of the yellow while the black were equal to the fourth part of the dappled and a fifth together with the whole of the yellow....

Another complicated problem with very big numbers. Smallest solution is in millions.

**Stomachion**

Puzzles, one example is the square split into many parts that can be rearranged into a square in hundreds of different ways, Archimedes found these! Very impressive.

### Timeline of Archimedes' Letters

The Big Letter to *Conon* (300 BCE) makes a challenge and talks about all the results he has achieved.

Conon dies and Archimedes sends his letters to *Dositheus* (300 BCE).

Sends more and more letters to Dositheus: Sphere and Cylinder I, II -- On Spirals -- Conoids and Spheroids.

**Archimedes False Claim** (in the original letter to Conon) he put it in to trick his "competitors" to agreeing that all his claims are true when they weren't.

## Two Main Themes

1. Measurements of curvilinear object (squaring the circle)

2. Difficult geometric proportions involving cubics and quadratics (doubling the cube)

### More About Conon

Conon's lock constellation in the sky, lock of Berenice. 230 BCE - 220 BCE were the times of the letters of Archimedes, before Conon's death.

The role of Conon and Archimedes is a goal to impress and humor important people (the court) with witty mathematics.
