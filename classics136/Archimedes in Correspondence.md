# CLASSICS 136: Archimedes in Correspondence

A lot of Archimedes' role came from being part of a network. Sending letter to each other. Recall the important figures, Conon and Dositheus.

We don't know much about Dositheus, some reports he engaged in astornomy, but minimal. All we know is that he had a correspondence with Archimedes.

Archimedes loved to challenge other people by sending them his results. This is clear when you realize that he sends "traps" or false proofs and sees if they fall for it.

He starts his correspondence with Dositheus with a proof on the area of a parabola compared to an outer / inner triangle (proof in class).

Parabolas to Greek Mathematicians is thought of as a proportion. Square to the line.

Measuring the cyliindrical cut, lots of curves like the lunule but can be measured like a lunule, with very specific measurements.

Two plane figures that have the same shape are to each other like the square of the analogous parts.

Cylindrical cut is a fraction of the cube (1/6).
