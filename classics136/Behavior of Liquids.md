# CLASSICS 136: Behavior of Liquids

Lots of early works on water by authors and mathematicians.

Archimedes discovered refraciton in liquids, how we can see objects in water despite being hidden by the edge.

Liquid was a source of marvel. Culturally and aesthetically charged. The nature of liquid is different than the solid.

In proofs by contradiction, the Greeks would make their diagrams look even more absurd than usual to accentuate the contradiction.

Does physics come from experiment or from abstraction? Experiments come LATER, science comes from abstractions (thinking in abstract ways about the physical world).
