# CLASSICS 136: Conics

How do greeks think about parabolas? As a conic section. Plane intersection with a cone creates a parabola if we just think about the surface of a cone and the intersection is at 90 degrees.

A hyperbola on the other hand is more complicated in Greek mathematics, they had a much more general definition that worked with an obtuse cone.

### Mathematics: Late 3rd Century BCE

The story of Conon, the court astronomer. Someone Archimedes appreciated. There were a lot of people besides Archimedes that we think are part of this generation (list distributed in class).

Things changed from the Archytas, Hippocrates and Euclid era into the generation of Archimedes.

They preferred the "carnival of calculation". Prioritized impressive results that generate suprise and unexpected combinations arose like physics and math.

Archimedes found all the semi-regular solids and proved that there's only 13 of them but we lost the proof. Kepler recovered a proof of the semi-regular solids (a verrrry difficult proof) and we're not sure that the proof was the same or similar to Archimede's proof.

One of the most important surviving books is a study of conics by Apollonius in 8 books (7 survived). The first 4 survived in Greek and Arabic translations exist for all 7 books.

Apollonius Treatise Calculating the Hexameter Line.

> Sing, nine maidens, of Artemis' excellent power - Apollonius



### Greek Numbers

$\Alpha, \Beta, \Gamma \dots \Iota, \Kappa \dots$

$1, 2, 3 \dots 10, 20 \dots$

Greek numbers are associated with letters, 24 total letters and 3 extra so 27 numbers (no zero).

Hyperbolas come in twos.

Euclid was fundamentally a toolbox, you want to understand Euclid? Then read Apollonius. He applies Euclid elements in a lot of contexts so it's a good way to learn how Euclid is applied.



### Apollonius' Conics

(Example in class about parabola and cone)

Quantative relations in figures.

Arc means change, but previously it means a geometrical object. Geometrical meaning in a Martin Luther King sermon??? Interesting I'm kinda lost.

The generation of Archimedes and Apollonius is quite advanced and the field becomes difficult to enter.

Diocles On Burning Mirrors (interesting proof).

Everyone was responding to Archimedes in this era.

Next class: treatise by Archimedes, what he does with conic sections.
