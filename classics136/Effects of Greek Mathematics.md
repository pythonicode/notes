# CLASSICS 136: Effects of Greek Mathematics

Greek astonomy: Ptolemy.

Two Rennaisance Books:

1. Copernicus, De Revolutionibus

2. Archimedes, First Edition

Commandino's Giant Leap: 1565

Galileo's First Achievement "The Small Balance": Recreating Archimedes' Eureka.

> ... all others are inferior to Archimedes ...

De Motu: Archimedes - to replace Aristotle.

> All natural motion of translation is the result of the proper heaviness ...

There is no need of Aristotle's physics to explain gravity and we would rather use Archimedes physics.

Galileo sees himself as a mathematician who can teach other people philosophy. 

Dialogues Concerning Two New Sciences - one of Galileo's important works.

> It was Archimedes' own books - which I had already read and studied ...

What is the result of the book? Free fall is quadratic.  Artillery consequences: projectiles will travel in a parabola.

Galileo says that the way to understand the world is mathematical not philisophical - AKA our teacher should be Archimedes not Aristotle.

Kepler says that the universe can be explained as being circumscribed by the 5 platonic solids. He also explained the motion of the planets.

How do we measure areas of an "egg" shape that Kepler suggested? He approximated the "egg" shape as an ellipse, but he soon realizes that the orbit IS an ellipse! Wow.

Toricelli, a "New Archimedes" the Toricelli object really impressed Galileo. Horn-like object.

Toricelli also figured out that air pressure prevents water from being pumped through a vacuum past a certain height. This led to the development of the steam engine, all from Archimedes!
