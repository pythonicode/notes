# CLASSICS 136: Floating Bodies

Archimedes' liquid hypothesis.

> Let the liquid be assumed to have such a nature so that the less pressed of its equally set and contiguous parts is pushed out by the more pressedand that each of its parts is pressed by te liquid perpendicularly above it.

Solids heavier than liquid will fully submerge in the liquid.

Lighter solids displace liquid equal to its weight.

Lighter solid immersed by force is pushed up by weight of equal liquid (its own weight)

Fully immersed solid in a liquid loses the weight of the liquid it displaced.
