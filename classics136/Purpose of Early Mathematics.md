# CLASSICS 136: Purpose of Early Mathematics

In 400 BCE, Syracuse, the Catapult was invented.

Recall the quotation by Polyclitus: "the well-made is achieved from many numbers". 

Philo quotes this when building/inventing catapults. Philo is an author on an early book about catapults and an engineer.

What is so mathematical about catapults?



### Building Machines

First came the crossbow, use mechanical construction to hold back a string and use tension to create energy. A coiled string can store more tension.

This was so important because having more catapults was the arms race of the times. If you are being sieges by many catapults, the only solution was to have your own catapults to defend against them. Defines an era.

A trebuchet is much more straightforward to produce, less precise and elegant than the catapult but very destructive technology. Popular in the middle ages, not many catapults mostly trebuchets.

For catapults, it's important to out-range enemy catapults and to be able to adjust range of the catapults during use. Mathematics and mathemeticians were used to "range" catapults or determine their max range and how to use it properly.

Learned that larger catapults (larger volume string) can shoot farther (seems obvious but not necessarily).



### Doubling the Cube

Finding the cubic root, solved by a machine. Eratosthenes "Tatami Room Doors" Soln.

AKA find a ratio of 4 lines in proportion.

$1 : 2^\frac{1}{3} : 2^\frac{2}{3} : 2$

Archytas may have been the first to offer a solution. He offered a 3 dimensional version that is difficult to understand visually. (criticized by other Greek)

However, it was a very beautiful proof with similar right triangles (example in class)

- Relationship within rectangles

- Similarity of triangles

How to go from ratio of lines to doubling the cube? I know $A$ and $D$, but I don't know $B$ and $C$ in $A : B : C : D$. What I do know is that $AD = BC$ and $AC = B^2$. 

Parabolas and conic sections, many clear properties of curves and proportions.

Menaechmus studied conics.
