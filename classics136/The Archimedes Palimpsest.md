# CLASSICS 136: The Archimedes Palimpsest

Manuscript A, a lost work in Greek History.

Combination of a lot of different books on mathematics etc.

Another manuscript called medieval manuscript B was also lost.

Often are lost to fires or worms. We have no idea.

A third medieval manuscript called manuscript C still exists!

5 ancient books on Methematical Physics and 5 more on Pure Geometry

The Method by Archimedes is only known through the Palimpsest.



### How did Archimedes survive?

Why did people in the middle ages create 3 copies of Archimedes works. 

Nobody else in Greek history has such fame as Archimedes, that's why his works were saved so much. They probably have heard about Archimedes and copied his works.

Papyrus is fairly easy to produce, just a plant. They were produced on the marsh because otherwise the plant would dry. They would produce rolls that were 10 meters long after unrolled.

Sewing in the medeival times allowed books to become large, being held together by thread.

Parchment, on the other hand, is the skin of animals. Much more expensive to produce than Papyri, but it is much better material and produces a much more robust book.

There are only 29 extant mathematical authors our of 150 attested.

About 270 total ancient Greek authors are extant.

In the Spanish Inquisition, everyone had to convert to Christianity but Jews who converted to Christianity were called Pagan *Marannos*.

Similar people probably existed in late antiquity, 5th and 6th century CE and kept Greek works safe in Constantinople.

In 1204, the Fourth Crusade occurred. Frankish warriors and a Venetian navy went to invade the Holy Land. Venetians and Franks sacked Constantinople in 1204 to recuperate economic losses of the Fourth Crusade because the city was so rich.

First two Archimedes manuscripts were taken to Rome, but the third manuscript was not. Lots of mistakes were in this manuscript that were not corrected, a vanity project.

In 1800s, there is a war in Jerusalem and the books are moved to Istanbul where Heiberg gets to read it in 1907.
